please ask for IT ticket for installation of 
1.python 3.6 or above
2.Anaconda IDE


There are 2 script files basically

NOTE:


1.	If the actual csv files has 2 columns or 3 columns depending on it the script has to be selected
2.	Then some images are blank thus endup with many particles, to avoid it I have excluded those (mostly first and last images are like this)
3.	If u want to run the script please copy and paste in the folder with the csv files
4.	if u wish to delete rows press 'y' and the number as to the script
5.	The excel file with name ‘step5Final’ contains all the mean and std calculated values.
